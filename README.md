📌 WPFrame – WordPress Plugin Development Framework

WPFrame is a lightweight framework designed to simplify and speed up WordPress plugin development.
It follows the Single-Instance Plugin Pattern and introduces structured architectures like MVC (Model-View-Controller) and FRC (Frontend-Routing-Controller), making plugin development more maintainable and scalable.

🚀 Features

🧩 MVC + FRC Structure → Encourages organized development with separation of concerns.

🔗 Integration with Popular Libraries → Utilizes components from CodeIgniter 3 and Laravel (Blade templating, Eloquent ORM, etc.).

💻 WPFX (CLI Tool) → Provides simple commands for generating plugin scaffolding and speeding up development.

🔓 Open Source → Licensed under MIT, free to use, extend, and contribute.
